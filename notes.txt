Instead of using templates and controllers, we can build an application using components implementing those features. 
And also use components instead of directives
And component based router ( which is more powerful than original router)
And different compositional patterns

This application is to identify that component based approach is the best way to program with Angular.

We can use controllers & directives to achieve the same goal, but which one is better? Controllers are easy to implement but not as powerful as directives. With directives we can create custom HTML elements.
Components combines easy programming model of controllers & powerful feature of directives(custom HTML elements)
